# Python Learnings

This repository contains code and notes related to learning Python. Follow the instructions below to install Python and run the Python scripts.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x must be installed on your system. If Python is not installed, follow the instructions below.

### Install Python

1. **Download Python**:  
   Go to the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

2. **Install Python**:  
   Run the installer and ensure that the **"Add Python to PATH"** option is checked during the installation process.  
   On Windows, this option allows you to run Python from the command line.

3. **Verify Installation**:  
   After installing Python, open a terminal/command prompt and run the following command to verify Python is installed:
   `python --version`

## Step 2 Cloning the Repository
1. To clone this repository and start working with the Python scripts, use the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-learnings.git
    After cloning, navigate to the project directory and start running the scripts as described below.
    ```

## Step 3: Running Python Scripts

1. **Open the terminal or command prompt** on your system.

2. **Navigate to the directory** where your Python script is located. Use the following command to move to the correct folder (replace `your-folder` with the actual folder name):

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your-folder 
After installing Python, you can run Python scripts by following these steps:
| Command          | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| `basics.py`      | Run a Python script                |
